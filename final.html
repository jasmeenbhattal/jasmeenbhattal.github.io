<strong> How to use Five Nights At Freddy's Program! </strong> <br>

Five Nights at Freddy's is a game that involves the player taking on the role of a security guard <br> who must survive five nights while monitoring a pizzeria filled with animatronic characters that<br> move around at night. The objective of the game is to survive until 6:00 AM while avoiding being <br> caught by the animatronics. <br>

To play the game, the player must use security cameras to monitor the various rooms in the pizzeria <br> and track the movements of the animatronics. The player can move through the various rooms checking <br> to see if the animatronics move. If the animatronic reaches the office the game will be over, try to survive <br> until 6:00 AM by clicking on the animatronics when you see them in the rooms. With each night, the game <br> becomes increasingly difficult, as the animatronics become faster.
